# Score-Keeper
So what we're going to make is a simple scorekeeping app. So I want you to think back to all those times that you've been playing rock paper scissors with a friend or ping pong or tic tac toe and it's just so tiring to keep track of the score and so difficult to know who's winning when this app is for you the way that it works.
